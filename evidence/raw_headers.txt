STATUS: MALICIOUS (PHISHING / CREDENTIAL HARVESTING)
========================================================================

--- MESSAGE IDENTIFIERS ---
Message ID:      <55965-[REDACTED]@TPwTr1c.yoq>
Created At:      Tue, Feb 17, 2026, 6:29 PM
Subject:         We've Blocked Your Account! [Data Deletion Threat]
Threat Window:   7 Hours (Urgency Social Engineering)

--- ROUTING & INFRASTRUCTURE ---
From:            [REDACTED] <alert-4825@og17i.mail.one.ass0023.canyona.biz.ua>
To:              [REDACTED_USER]@og17i.yy
Origin IP:       50.2.36.41 (DigitalOcean - USA)
Sender Domain:   canyona.biz.ua (Ukraine TLD)
Relay Server:    anhanguera.com (Compromised Brazilian University Infrastructure)

--- AUTHENTICATION AUDIT (TECHNICAL CONTROLS) ---
SPF:             PASS (Origin IP 50.2.36.41 authorized by DNS)
DKIM:            PASS (Cryptographic signature verified for sender domain)
DMARC:           PASS (Alignment confirmed between From and DKIM domains)

--- AUDITOR NOTES ---
1. DYNAMIC IDENTITY INJECTION: The adversary programmatically scraped 
   the handle "[REDACTED]" and mirrored it in the "From" display name
   to bypass human 'stranger-danger' heuristics.
   
2. PROTOCOL EXPLOITATION: The "PASS" results for SPF/DKIM/DMARC indicate 
   a technically mature adversary with established DNS infrastructure. 
   Traditional reputation-based filters are ineffective against this vector.
